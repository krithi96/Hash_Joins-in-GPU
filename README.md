# Hash_Joins-in-GPU
Designing a faster join of two tables by using GPU

- In this project, we are implementing a left join of two input tables of different sizes using the hash-join algorithm on a GPU. 
- We used the cuckoo hashing concepts to avoid collision in our hash table. 
- Finally, we did some performance analysis by running our hash-join in different machines,with different table size to see how it scales horizontally.
