Air travel is now estimated to be as much as 5\% of worldwide GHGE \cite{Lee09}.  
For UC, it may be as much as 17\% \cite{reports},
although different reporting methodologies on the different campuses currently lead to
widely varying estimates.
My research will develop Web and mobile tools to help UC travelers reduce the
greenhouse gas emissions produced by their trips.

Most carbon calculators use a rough rule of thumb for calculating $CO_2E$ (greenhouse gas
effect equivalent to tons of $CO_2$ emitted). For instance, COTAP.org uses the formula:
$$
\frac {m  \times e  \times r}{2205}
$$
where $m$ is miles traveled, $e$ is an emissions factor in lbs of $CO_2$ per mile, set to $.631$ for short
trips, $.731$ for medium-distance trips, and $.427$ for long trips, and finally $r = 1.9$ is a radiative forcing
index intended to cover the effect of releasing greenhouse gasses high in the atmosphere rather than
on the surface.
But these calculations are very rough, and don't take into effect issues like the specific aircraft used,
which can have a huge effect.
